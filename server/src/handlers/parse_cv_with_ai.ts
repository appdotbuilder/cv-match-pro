    // - Total years of work experience

    // - Frequency of job changes (calculated as jobs per year)
    // - List of roles/positions held
    // - Skills mentioned throughout the CV
    // - Dominant industries based on work history
    // - Contact information (email, phone, location)
    // - Education background
    // 
    // Should handle various CV formats and languages.
    // Should use OCR for scanned PDFs and text extraction for digital PDFs.
    // Should implement error handling for unparseable documents.
