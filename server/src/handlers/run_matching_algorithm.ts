    // 
    // Core Algorithm Components:
    // 1. Rule-based scoring: Calculate scores for years of experience, job stability, etc.
    // 2. Vector-based scoring: Use semantic similarity for skills and role matching
    // 3. Weighted scoring: Apply project-specific weights to each scoring dimension
    // 4. Ranking: Sort candidates by final weighted score
    // 
    // Scoring Dimensions:
    // - Years Experience: Compare actual vs minimum required
    // - Role Match: Semantic similarity between target role and CV roles
    // - Skills Match: Exact + semantic matching of required/preferred skills
    // - Industry Match: Overlap between target industries and CV industries
    // - Job Stability: Penalize frequent job changes based on criteria
    // 
    // Should update project_cvs table with new scores and rankings.
